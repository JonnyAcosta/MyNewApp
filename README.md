# Overview

This app helps new programmers to get their initial footing in several programming languages. It teaches functions and other important coding tips. This app is designed to store user data as well, so that they can progress through tests, flashcards, and learning modules. The user can use the app by selecting which learning style they would like to try, and then progressing through various learning exercises. As a group we had the opportunity to learn about how to use react-native and java to code a mobile app. We stretched a lot in learning to apply data storage libraries and try to make a visually appealing app. 


# Development Environment

React Native- Used for designing a mobile app compatible for both IOS and Android. It also has live time updates for checking and improving code. 
Async Storage- Library in react native used for storing user data. 
Java- Programming language we used for the app design.  

# Useful Websites

* React Native- https://reactnative.dev/ 
* Expo https://docs.expo.dev/ 

# Future Work

* We can add more features in the add to give a variety of option for the app. 
* We can improve on the style of the app by adding features that can make the app more interactive. 
* We can add sounds and noises to the app to give the user a way to know the right or wrong answer with a ding.
